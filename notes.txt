Bugs:
$ python get_ratings.py Sunday 08/16/2012 > sunday_ratings_to_last_year &
$ grep -i "game of thrones" sunday_ratings_to_last_year

>> There's a bug on page 12, for some reason the date is being written as the previous week.  Then we end up with 2x 05/05/2013.



Todo:
	x. add command line args
		Handle all command line args
	x.	Format end_date
	check iff date is valid
		and if query_date is valid.  
		x. Handle iff year rolls over
	cycle through pagination
		x. compare to end date
	testing?

python <day of week> <opt> <stop date>

	WHERE
		search query is a day of the week?
			--> strings like "sunday cable ratings" are useful
				So, we need to distinguish between the streams as well; ie network vs cable
	
		stop_date is a fixed date? => Month atm
	
Output:
AIR_DATE ... Show	Net	Time	Viewership (million, Live+SD)	Adults 18-49 rating (Live+SD)

Creation:
	Tvbythenumbers normally pushes data on airdate/the next day.
	Posting date is @ the head of the file, we can probably just regex this.
	
	Subsequent data might just conform to the format
	str		UPPER(string < 5 chars)		[0-9]:[0-9][0-9]		[0-9]*\.[0.9]* 		[0-9]*\.[0.9]* 	

	
	Then just use grep to pull relevant rows?
	
Questions:
	How to disambiguate search results?
		title is "Nothing found..." after exceeding results.
		So, we can just do while !found and & maybe look @ headers?
