Todo:
	add command line args
	check iff date is valid
	cycle through pagination
	testing?

python <search query> <stop date>

	WHERE
		search query is a day of the week?
			--> strings like "sunday cable ratings" are useful
				So, we need to distinguish between the streams as well; ie network vs cable
	
		stop_date is a fixed date?
	
Output:
AIR_DATE ... Show	Net	Time	Viewership (million, Live+SD)	Adults 18-49 rating (Live+SD)

Creation:
	Tvbythenumbers normally pushes data on airdate/the next day.
	Posting date is @ the head of the file, we can probably just regex this.
	
	Subsequent data might just conform to the format
	str		UPPER(string < 5 chars)		[0-9]:[0-9][0-9]		[0-9]*\.[0.9]* 		[0-9]*\.[0.9]* 	

	
	Then just use grep to pull relevant rows?
	
Questions:
	How to disambiguate search results?
		title is "Nothing found..." after exceeding results.
		So, we can just do while !found and & maybe look @ headers?
