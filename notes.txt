Bugs:

	x. $ grep -i "game of thrones" sunday_ratings_to_last_year
	x. >> There's a bug on page 12, for some reason the date is being written as the previous week.  Then we end up with 2x 05/05/2013.

Todo:
	x. add command line args
		Handle all command line args
	x.	Format end_date
	check iff date is valid
		and if query_date is valid.  
		x. Handle iff year rolls over
	x. cycle through pagination

Output:
